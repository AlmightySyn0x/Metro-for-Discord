# Addons
Install these as you would with any other theme, and enable them alongside Metro for Discord. Some addons may need some extra steps on your part to make them work correctly, so read the instructions at the top of the file.

# Speech Bubbles
Originally an idea from Uri's private theme, then it was nicked by every other theme dev. It simply shows chat inside speech bubbles.
