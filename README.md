# Metro for Discord
A custom theme for Discord (BetterDiscord) based on Microsoft's Modern Design Language - 'Metro'.  
Currently: `v2.22.9`  

#### A quick note on updates
I'm currently working on re-writing Metro for Discord from scratch. For the time being v2 will only receive updates for major changes. The CSS for the new settings pages has been removed intentionally as doing a complete update would take too much time away from working on v3. Sorry!

You can track progress on the [v3 project board](https://github.com/TakosThings/Metro-for-Discord/projects/3) or, if you want to be on the cutting edge you can [change to the v3 branch](https://github.com/TakosThings/Metro-for-Discord/tree/v3) and download the latest version. BetterDiscord users will have to add the `//META` line themselves.

# Installation

# User settings
You can change the accent colour by editing `--accent` in the `:root` section of the theme. By default it is dark blue.  
A colour sheet is available in [accent.md](https://github.com/TakosThings/Metro-for-Discord/blob/master/accent.md)  

# Userstyle
Metro For Discord is also available as a [Userstyle](https://userstyles.org/styles/136340/metro-for-discord) for Discord in the browser. Use [Stylus for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) or [StylRRR for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylrrr/).
