# Metro for Discord
A custom theme for Discord (BetterDiscord) inspired by Metro For Steam.  
Currently: `v1.5.1`  
I'm re-writing the whole theme to fix the complete fustercluck of vars I used. It'll be released in whole soon:tm:

# Installation
[Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TakosThings/Metro-for-Discord/master/Metro_for_Discord.theme.css)  
Follow [this guide](https://betterdocs.net/install_theme.html) to install the theme  
You'll also need to go to Appearance settings and choose the light theme.

# User settings
There are some settings you can change in the top of the css file.  
A colour sheet is available in [accent.md](https://github.com/TakosThings/Metro-for-Discord/blob/master/accent.md)  
`--theme-accent:` This is your accent color, it appears on some places to show an option is toggled.  
`--theme-accent-faded:` Same as above, but with 0.8 alpha. It's only used on the "X new messages since" bar.  
Backgrounds  
`--theme-profile-bg:` Background on user profiles. Images must be over HTTPS!  
`--theme-profile-bg-pos:` Background position for user profiles  
Status Indicators  
`--theme-user-online:` Green border around avatars for online status  
`--theme-user-idle:` Orange for idle status  
`--theme-user-offline:` Grey for offline status  
Everything below `/* END CONFIG */` you should probably leave alone
