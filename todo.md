# To Do
* Having Discord's Dark theme selected isn't supported. This may be fixed in a future update, but isn't top priority.
* Unstyled:
  - Server Settings > Members
  - Server Settings > Roles (just a few touch ups)
  - Server Settings > Bans
  - Server Settings > Widget
* Create/Join boxes in the new server modal
* New server button still has the default background
* Modal headers are *way* too large
* Tooltips
* Add Roles/Members box is still default theme
* Help modal
* BetterDiscord: Emote menu is still default theme
* BetterDiscord: Public Servers modal

# Bugs
* The expanding delete button has sizing issues, a new hack is needed
* Text in Leave Server modal body is wrong colour
* A few pixels of chat go missing when emotes are used. (aka. the emote autoscrolling bug)
* Disabled checkbox is pure white
* Current section in Emoji menu should use --theme-accent
* Still can't narrow down the jumpling account box thing. Could possible be caused by the members list updaing with new members, but isn't reproducable.
