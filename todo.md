# To Do
* Add Roles/Members box is still default theme
* Connection info popup
* Voice debug
* Help modal
* BetterDiscord: Public Servers modal

# Bugs
* Still can't narrow down the jumping account box thing. Could possibly be caused by the members list updaing with new members, but isn't reproducable.
